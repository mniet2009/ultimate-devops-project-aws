# Run the project Locally

In this lecture we will use the `docker compose` which is installed as part of `docker`.

Just go to the directory of cloned repo and run `docker compose up`.

Video of the lecture is self explanatory.

 If we have lauch an EC2 instance and storage is 8 GB then we receive a error 
##write /var/lib/docker/tmp/GetImageBlob2962295582: no space left on device
To Resolve this , first we have to go to Instance--- Storage and Increase the size from 8 GB to 30GB, 
it will take some time to modify(15-20 minutes) when status is ##in-use##
then we have to run below commands
``` 
df-h
```
